--------------------

Bernhard Saumweber:
	- Groups can now be filtered by number of specific classes in group, e.g. warriors >= 1
	- Fixed the gray "no groups found" text not being shown when filters removed all search results.
	- Settings are now saved per character. Added dungeon variables to info tooltip. Extra rule for Violet Hold added (has fixed three bosses every week). More refactoring.
	- Supports new variables noid/partialid/fullid that can be used to filter groups where you don't have an ID lockout or where you have only a partial lockout. Groups tooltips now show the classes that are currently in the group. Refactored a lot of code.
	- Raising version to 1.4 for next release
	- The following expressions can now be used to filter for specific legion dungeons: eoa/dht/hov/nl/vh/brh/vot/mos/cos/aw/kara. Example: "cos or aw" shows only Court of Stars or The Arcway dungeon groups.
	- Advanced filter expression can now be set with a macro, which allows you to load frequently used expressions. Using the macro command will reset all filters, set the advanced expression and start a search. If the Premade Groups Filter window is not visible, nothing happens. Example: /run PGFMacro(" tanks == 0 ")
	- Selecting a difficulty in the dropdown now checks the corresponding checkbox.
	- New groups are now shown in green when doing the same search repeatedly. A new group is either a group that has just been created or which properties have changed so that it now matches the filter critera. Groups are now sorted by age, newest groups at the top.
